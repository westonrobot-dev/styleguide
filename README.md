# Weston Robot Style Guides

The style guides listed on this page are adopted from [Google Style Guide](https://westonrobot-dev.github.io/styleguide/) and adjusted for use within Weston Robot.

<!-- Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent
style.  -->

<!-- “Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to
“never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” This project
([google/styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide)) links to the style
guidelines we use for Google code. If you are modifying a project that
originated at Google, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides
that apply to that project. -->

<!-- This project also contains [cpplint][cpplint], a tool to assist with style guide
compliance, and [google-c-style.el][emacs], an Emacs settings file for Google
style.

If your project requires that you create a new XML document format, the
[XML Document Format Style Guide][xml] may be helpful. In addition to actual
style rules, it also contains advice on designing your own vs. adapting an
existing format, on XML instance document formatting, and on elements vs.
attributes. -->
